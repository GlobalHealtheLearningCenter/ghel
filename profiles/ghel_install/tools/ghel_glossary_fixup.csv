Effectively managing human resources begins with workforce planning. For single practitioner businesses - such as a midwife practitioner or a one-person kiosk business selling family planning products - this is not an issue until the business grows enough for more than one employee. For other business models with more than one employee workforce planning needs careful attention - otherwise a business can be over or under staffed, resulting in inefficient staffing and paying too much for salary and benefits.

2791,,No Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV),,,"Major Differences between NSV and Incisional Vasectomy: With NSV, two specialized instruments—a ringed clamp and a dissecting forceps—are used instead of a scalpel. The NSV technique uses a vasal nerve block, which provides better anesthesia than simply anesthesizing the skin around the entry point. Because the scrotal skin puncture with the dissecting forceps is so small, sutures are not needed.

NSV offers several advantages over incisional vasectomy. NSV results in fewer
hematomas and infections than does conventional incisional vasectomy. Men undergoing NSV reported less pain during the procedure and early in the follow-up period than did men having an incisional vasectomy and also reported earlier resumption of sexual activity after surgery. Neither incisional nor no-scalpel vasectomy is time-consuming; however, there are reports of decreased operating time when skilled providers use the no-scalpel approach. For example, in the United States, a 40% reduction in operating time has been reported with NSV.

A recent situation analysis of District A demonstrated limited access to young adult reproductive health services. Young adults (ages 15-24) account for 30% of the population in District A, yet reproductive health service statistics show that only 5% of the people using the services were in this age range. Anecdotal evidence from district health workers suggests a high incidence of unwanted pregnancies and a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS among young adults. As part of the national commitment to improve the reproductive health of young adults, the Ministry of Health will implement a five-year project aimed at increasing access to youth-friendly health services by improving the infrastructure necessary to deliver such services, and in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Youth, focusing on reproductive health education for youth ages 10-24.",28,M&E Fundamentals

1276,,Vulnerability,,HIV Vulnerabiliby,"Results from a range of factors outside the control of the individual that reduces the ability of the individual and communities to avoid HIV risk. These factors may include:
- lack of knowledge and skills required to protect oneself and others;
- factors pertaining to the quality and coverage of services (e.g., inaccessibility of services due to distance, cost or other factors); and
- societal factors such as human rights violations, or social and cultural norms. These norms can include practices, beliefs and laws that stigmatize and disempower certain populations, limiting their ability to access or use HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services and commodities.
These factors, alone or in combination, may create or exacerbate individual and collective vulnerability to HIV (UNAIDS, 2007).
